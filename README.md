# [Snap2PDF](https://www.snap2pdf.net)
A Flask app to convert images to PDF

**How It Works**

1. Select up to 10 image files (JPEG, JPG, or PNG).
2. Click "Convert to PDF" to process your files.
3. Your PDF will appear on your screen instantly!

**Why Convert Images to PDFs?**

Save Space: Combining multiple images into a single PDF can significantly reduce the overall file size, making it easier to store and share.

Improved Organization: PDFs are easier to manage and keep track of compared to individual image files.

Quick Sharing: A single PDF file is much simpler to email or upload than multiple separate images.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: PDFs maintain their formatting across devices and operating systems, ensuring your documents look professional everywhere.

**Open Source and Privacy**

Snap2PDF is open source, and we value transparency. You can view the source code on our GitHub repository. We prioritize your privacy: uploaded files are processed locally and are deleted after conversion. Rest assured, we do not save or view your files.
